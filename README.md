# exodus-nes-text-exporter
This code helps to extract the text of the questions from the NES game called "Exodus - Journey to the Promised Land (USA) (v4.0) (Unl)" by "Wisdom Tree". Make sure it has this hash before using it:<br>
`ROM CRC32: AB26DB6`

Usage: Copy this file into the same directory as the NES file the use  
`extractor.py <nesfile.nes> <textfile.txt>`

Then you can use any text editor, I recommend Notepad++.

If you want to insert again yo can use my inserter [here.](https://github.com/KodingBTW/exodus-nes-text-inserter)
